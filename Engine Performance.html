   IV closes 35 degree after BDC to take the advantage of momentum of rapidly moving gases (ram effect)
   ignition occurs 35 degree before TDC , this is to allow the time delay between the spark and commencement of comustion . <br>
   EV opens at 35 degreee before BDC , else pressure will rise enormously , and the work required to expel the gas will increase . <br>
   EV closed at 10 degree after TDC , this is to increase the volumetric efficiency . </p>
  <center> <h1>supercharging system </h1> </center>
   <h3>Definition</h3>
   <p>
    Basically supercharging means supplying high pressure air to the engine . <br>
       The method of increasing the air capacity or density of an engine in known as supercharging . <br>
       supercharger is merely a blower or a compressor that provides a denser charge to the engine . <br>
   </p>
<h3>objectives</h3>
<p>
    for ground installations it is used to produce a gain in the power output of the engine . <br>
    for aircraft installations , in addition to produce a gain in the power output at sea levle , it also enables the engine to maintain a higher power output as altitude is increased. <br>

</p>
<h2>SI engines </h2>
<p>
    supercharging in SI engine is employed only in aircraft and racing car engines . 
    Apart from increasing the volumetric effciency of the engine , supercharging results in an increase in the intake temperature of the engine.

</p>
<h3>CI engine</h3>
<p>
    in case of CI engines , supercharging dose not result in any combustion problem , rather it improves combustion . 

</p>
<h3>supercharging methods </h3>
<h4>1. mechanical supercharger</h4>
<p>   The compressor is driven by the engine output shaft through some gears. The compressor supplies high pressure air to the engine. Finally the gases are exhausted as shown. <br>
    Note that a part of total output is used for driving the compressor and net output power increases because of supercharging. <br>
    exhaust gases from the engine drive the turbine which in turn drives the compressor.
    <p>  
    <h4>2. Turbocharging  </h4>
   <p>
    turbine and compressor are coupled as shown. The compressor takes the air from atmosphere and after increasing the pressure it will be supplied to the engine. 
    And this type of arrangement is nowadays generally used and is called as Turbocharging

<h3>Fuel injection system </h3>
<p>
    Fuel injector is an electronically controlled mechanical device that is responsible for spraying (injecting) the
     right amount of fuel into the engine so that a suitable air/fuel mixture is created for optimal combustion. <br>
    note that : <br>
    1. the fuel injection system most occur at the correct moment. <br>
    2. it should supply the fule in correct quantity as required bt the varying engine loads. <br>
    3. the injected fuel must be broken into very fine droplets. <br>
    4. the spray pattern should ensure rapid mixing of fuel and air. <br>
    5. it should supply equal quantites of metered fuel to all the cylinders in a mulit cylinder engines. <br> 
    6. the beginning and the end of injection should be sharp. <br>
    <h4>There are two methods of fuel injection in the compression ignition system </h4> 

    <h3>element of fule injection system</h3> 
    1. pumping element : to supply fuel from fuel tank to cylinder . <br>
    2. metering element : to meter fule supply as per load and Speed . <br>
    3. distribution element : to divide the metered fuel equaally among the cylinder . <br> 
    4. timing control : to adjust the start and stop of injection . <br>
    5. mixing element : to atomize and distrbute the fuel within the combustion chamber . <br>
<h3>types of injecting system</h3> 

1.Air blast injection <br>
<p>This method was originally used in large stationary and marine engines. But now it is obsolete. <br>
    In this method, the air is first compressed to very high pressure. A blast of this air is then injected carrying the fuel along with it into the cylinders. The rate of fuel injection is controlled by varying the pressure of the air. The high-pressure air requires a multi-stage compressor so as to keep the air bottles charged. The fuel ignites by the high temperature of the air caused by the high compression. The compressor consumes about 10% of the power developed by the engine, decreasing the net output of the engine.</p>

2.Airless or solid injector  <br>
<p>
    In this method, the fuel under high pressure is directly injected into the combustion chamber. It burns due to the heat of compression of the air. This method requires a fuel pump to deliver the fuel at high pressure around 300kg/cm^2. This method is used for all types of small and big diesel engines. It can be divided into two systems <br>

    1. Individual pump system: in this system each cylinder has its own individual high-pressure pump and a measuring unit. <br>
    
    2. Common rail system: in this system the fuel is pumped by a multi-cylinder pump into a common rail, the pressure in the rail is controlled by a relief valve. A measured quantity of fuel is supplied to each cylinder from the common rail. <br>

<h3>Lubrication system</h3>
<p>
    produce of lubrication : <br>
     1. to teduce the frictional resistance of the engine to a minimum to ensure maxmimum mechanical effciency . <br>
     2. protect the engine against wear . <br> 
     3. serve as a cooling agent by picking uo heat . <br>
     4. remove all impurities from the lubricated region . <br>
     5. form a seal between piston rings and the cylinder walls to prevent blower . <br>
